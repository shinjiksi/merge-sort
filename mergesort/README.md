## author : Shinji Kasai

## comments
Since C is not my favorite language, I had a difficult time understanding and dealing with pointers and using keywords. This project was a good first project because I am familiar how merge sort is working and I actually liked the difficulty of this project. The given files such as lab.c helped me understanding how to do in C and I walked through the code and drew it, so I could see visually how the code is working. 

Also, I liked we had a chance to talk woth other student during the class as in the breake room, so we could discuss how far were at the project and exchange our ideas.
